    <h1>Trying to understand Git and Github</h1>
    <p>
      Git and Github seem to be one of the key prerequisites to making it as a
      developer. I do have a bit of knowledge but i do feel that it is shallow
      and i am trying to become better with both. Man, my commit messages are
      awful, hoping to improve on that too.
